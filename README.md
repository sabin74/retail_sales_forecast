# Retail Sales Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting retail sales using historical sales data and time-series regression techniques. It leverages Python, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost to build predictive models capable of forecasting sales trends. The goal is to provide actionable insights to retailers for inventory and sales strategy planning.


## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Retail Dataset  
- **Link:** [Kaggle Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data)  
- **Description:** The dataset contains daily sales data for multiple stores and items, including promotional information and sales figures over time.


## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning)  
- XGBoost (advanced regression modeling)  
- Joblib (model saving and loading)
